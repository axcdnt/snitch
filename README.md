# Snitch

This is a pet project command line app that helps by watching your test files and running them as soon as possible. It's configurable through params.

It works **only for Go** files and it's highly inspired on [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard).

Notice that you must have Go installed. :heart:

## How to

### Compilation

`go build`

### Run

`./snitch --path <root-path> --time <time>`
